# basic-node-express

# To Run The Application

# Step 1:
    npm i
# Step 2:
    cd mongo-db-docker-compose
    docker-compose up -d
# Step 3:
    npm start
# Step 4:
    open link http://localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger

Note: Step 2 is only needed if Mongo DB is not installed in machine. Using Step 2 we can quickly containerize mongo db in 1 min.
      Before doing Step 2 make sure docker and docker-compose should be installed in your machine.

Have Fun !!!
